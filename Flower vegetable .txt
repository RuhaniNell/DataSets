I look forward to the day
where my studying will pay,
The day my career is set,
Saving lives will be my job, you bet, 
Where I’ll put on those gloves
and where people will say “this is the job she loves”


This ambition, the greatest of all my ambitions
is one of my greatest possessions,
This is what I care about,
The career that I will scout, 
Every day with a smile on my face
no matter what the case,


I will work hard for it
and I will study every single bit,
I will learn whatever I can,
Make any type of plan,
This is my future,
My very proud future,


I’ll look straight ahead
right to the school of med,
No matter how many years of studying this,
I’ll find myself in a doctor office
not as a patient
but as a doctor with patience,
For a piece of someone’s pain, 
For a whole of someone’s pain.
I will be there, that’s my gain,
I’ll be confident
and I’ll be tolerant,
Whatever comes my way,
Everyday will be a good day,


My breath will prove how happy I am,
My smile will tell people about this happy ma’am!
