AVID
        I have made the decision to apply for AVID because I know that it will help my weaknesses turn into strengths and help my current strengths improve. It will help me with my information about colleges and also help me improve with being organized, and with note-taking skills. 


        My goal is to be more helpful to myself, and to those around me. I want to learn more responsibility and be helpful to those in my life. Another thing I have as a goal is to get into a medical college. I know AVID will help me with college and being successful in life. I also want to be organized and be a great note-taker! I love taking notes, and AVID will help me organize them and help me with other classes. I think some strengths I may have are note-taking and organizing. 
        
        What makes me individually determined is knowing that I have the ability to do something, as well as the time to do something. Sometimes, what also makes me individually determined is being in charge of the project or activity. 


        As an AVID member, I hope I can contribute by being helpful and making other people’s lives easier.  As I learn from AVID, I hope that I will be helpful in my house by being organized. I also hope I can be helpful to myself in school by maintaining a good schedule. 


        I know middle school will not be exactly like elementary school and I know that middle may mean taking up more responsibility. AVID will help me balance things out to make things easier. AVID will help me with all these things; going from keeping me organized to helping me with college. I hope I get to be a member and a part of AVID so I can help others, as well as AVID will help me. I will maintain the grades to be in AVID, I will be a good role model to others, and I will be a good citizen. And this is why I feel that AVID will suit me.
